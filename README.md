# Vehicle Sales Analysis Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes vehicle sales data across different states and vehicle categories using **SQL** for data processing and **Power BI** for visualization.

## üìÇ Files in This Repository
- **vehicle_sales_analysis.pbix** ‚Üí Power BI report with visualizations
- **vehicle_sales_queries.sql** ‚Üí SQL queries for data analysis
- **reshaped_vehicle_sales.csv** ‚Üí Dataset used in the analysis
- **README.md** ‚Üí Project documentation

## üìä Power BI Visualizations
The Power BI report includes:
- **Bar Chart:** Total vehicle sales by state
- **Stacked Bar Chart:** Vehicle sales breakdown by category per state
- **Pie Chart:** Market share of each vehicle category
- **Top & Bottom 5 States:** States with the highest and lowest sales

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Processing Steps
### 1‚É£ Database & Table Creation
```sql
CREATE DATABASE vehicle;
USE vehicle;
CREATE TABLE vehicle_sale (
    state VARCHAR(50),
    category VARCHAR(100),
    total_sold INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (state, category)
);
```
### 2‚É£ Data Import
```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'reshaped_vehicle_sales.csv'
INTO TABLE vehicle_sale
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```
### 3‚É£ Key SQL Queries
- **Total Sales by Category**
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sold) AS total_sales
FROM vehicle_sale
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```
- **Top 5 States by Sales**
```sql
SELECT state, SUM(total_sold) AS total_sales
FROM vehicle_sale
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
- **Market Share Analysis**
```sql
SELECT state, SUM(total_sold) AS total_sales,
       ROUND(SUM(total_sold) * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(total_sold) FROM vehicle_sale), 2) AS market_share
FROM vehicle_sale
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY market_share DESC;
```

## üöÄ How to Use
1. **Verify MySQL Connector Installation:**
   - Open **ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)** in Windows.
   - Go to the **Drivers** tab and check if **MySQL ODBC 8.0 Unicode Driver** is listed.
     - ‚ùå **Not found?** Install MySQL Connector/ODBC 8.0.33+ again.
     - ‚úÖ **Found?** Move to the next step.
2. **Install MySQL .NET Connector (Important for Power BI):**
   - Download and install **MySQL Connector/NET 8.0.33** or later from the MySQL website.
3. **Run SQL Queries:** Use MySQL Workbench to execute the provided SQL queries.
4. **Open Power BI Report:** Load `vehicle_sales_analysis.pbix` to view visualizations.
5. **Modify & Customize:** Update queries or visuals as needed for further insights.

## üèÜ Key Insights
‚úîÔ∏è The highest vehicle sales were recorded in **State X**.
‚úîÔ∏è **Two-wheelers** dominate the market in most states.
‚úîÔ∏è **Public service vehicles** have the lowest sales among categories.
‚úîÔ∏è **State Y** has the least vehicle sales, contributing only **Z%** of total sales.

## üì¢ Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into vehicle sales trends, helping businesses understand state-wise market demand. Future improvements could include additional datasets, time-series analysis, and predictive modeling.
